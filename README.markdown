# Redmine Burndowns

## Introduction

This plugin adds a 'Burndown' tab to your Project Menu for any Project with the 'Burndowns' module enabled (Settings>Modules). 

This tab will show the Burndown chart for the current Sprint (cough Version cough), and also give a sidebar listing of all previous Sprints to see their Burndown chart as well. The Burndown Chart shows the current work remaining in red and an ideal trend line in grey.
